## 📰 News

* **[2025.4.3]**  🔥 We have released **GPT-ImgEval: A Comprehensive Benchmark forDiagnosing GPT4o in Image Generation**. Check out the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.02782). The code and dataset are coming soon.

## 🏆 Contributions

* **GPT-4o Image Generation Evaluation:** GPT-4o excels in image generation, surpassing previous models across benchmarks like text-to-image (GenEval), editing (Reason-Edit), and world knowledge-informed generation (WISE).
* **Architecture Analysis:** Our analysis suggests GPT-4o uses a Diffusion architecture for its decoder, with a potential speculative model for its encoder.
* **Detailed Analysis:** We explore GPT-4o’s generation strengths and weaknesses, compare its multi-round editing capabilities with Gemini 2.0 Flash, and assess image detectability for safety.

## 💻 Auto-Script

The current script only supports automatically **sending text to generate images** in bulk, but does not support automatically downloading the generated images.

### Prerequisites

* macOS with M1/M2/M3/M4 chip
* [ChatGPT desktop app](https://chatgpt.com/download) installed

### Usage

```bash
python chatgpt_script.py # NO SUPPORT AUTO-DOWNLOAD IMAGE
```

### Troubleshooting

If the tool isn't functioning correctly:

* Make sure ChatGPT app is installed and you're logged in.
* Verify that all required permissions have been granted.

## 🤗 Dataset Download

We uploaded the GPT generation results for the Reason-Edit and GenEval datasets, which can be downloaded 📁 [here](https://github.com/PicoTrex/GPT-ImgEval).

We will also upload our automated script within these two days to facilitate more people to evaluate GPT-4o's image synthesis capabilities.

## 🔥 Evaluation results

According to the table, GPT4o achieves the highest overall score of 0.84, largely outperforming both the frozen text encoder methods and the LLM/MLLM-enhanced approaches.

As shown in the bar chart , GPT-4o significantly outperforms all existing image editing methods on the Reason-Edit bench-mark, achieving a remarkable score of **0.929**. This represents a substantial leap of **+0.357** over the best-performing method prior to 2025 (SmartEdit, **0.572**), highlighting the model’s powerful instruction-following ability and fine-grained editing control.

GPT-4o significantly outperforms existingspecialized T2I generation methods and unified MLLM-based approaches in terms of overall WiScore. GPT-4o combines exceptional world knowledge understanding with high-fidelity image generation, demonstrating a dual strength in multimodal generation tasks.

## 🤔 Generate Architecture

Beyond benchmark evaluations, we conduct deeper analyses to uncover GPT-4o's potential architectural choices. Specifically, we first explore whether GPT-4o relies on a diffusion-based or autoregressive decoder head. To this end, we propose a model-based classification method, where a standard binary classifier is trained to distinguish between images generated by the two paradigms, and then applied to GPT-4o's outputs. Interestingly, the classifier consistently classi-fies GPT-4o's images as diffusion-based, providing empirical evidence that GPT-4o may internally use a diffusion head for image decoding.
